===========

Simple anaglyph image generator written in Python and PIL.

It can generate a few different types of stereo images:

- red/cyan anaglyphs: true, monochrome, color, half color and optimized algorithms (see [this page](http://www.3dtv.at/knowhow/anaglyphcomparison_en.aspx) for details).
- stereo pairs: parallel or cross-eyed viewing, in color or monochrome.
- wiggle 3D animated GIFs
